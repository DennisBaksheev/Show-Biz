            <p>In completing this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of web application development, with a particular focus on security aspects. I learned to implement roles and manage authentication and authorization processes effectively. Creating and associating design model classes for actors, shows, and episodes taught me the importance of data modeling in the application's structure. Additionally, I delved into the intricacies of database management, including table creation and the establishment of associations between entities. This hands-on experience has significantly enhanced my technical skills in building secure and well-structured web applications.</p>
